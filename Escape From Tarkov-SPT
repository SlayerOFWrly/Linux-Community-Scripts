Install BSG launcher via Lutris Install Script from their website, once download completed, copy the game or use the existing install and extract all SPT .zip contents  > "Escape From Tarkov" root directory, enter account credentials to BSGLauncher then proceed to install

"sudo pacman -S aspnet-runtime-9.0" (This is a requirement for Arch Systems to be able to launch SPT, as of 2025-14-12)

In lutris you duplicate the vanilla EFT install,give it a new name, then over to game options in the configure tab, the "Executable" should now point to the "SPT.Launcher.exe".

the original vanilla game you can now uninstall or keep for whenever the devs want to enable BattleEye Support between Linux and Windows

The rest of this install will work on that SPT version of Tarkov,

(Probably best to not run this config on vanilla game if even possible, high chance of ban hammer for custom DLLs)

In lutris click the arrow directly beside the wine icon, open a bash terminal and run "winetricks --self-update", "winetricks -q arial times vcrun2022 dotnetdesktop6 dotdesktop8" and finally "dotnetdesktop9"

Clicking now the arrow next to Start in lutris: Click Configure and then "Runner Options" "DLL Overrides", add "winhttp" as a key and the value is "n,b"

Lastly, click over to "System Runner"  tab, then add these Enviroment Variables "DOTNET_ROOT" and lastly "DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR"  (these don't require a value to work)

If all goes well you should be able to run "SPT.Server.Linux" from the bash terminal we opened earlier, you'll need to navigate to your EFT install folder and depending on file placement that SPT.Server.Linux will be either in your EFT install or in the SPT folder somewhere, just use "cd" or a file manager to find it to launch it, then launch SPT from Lutris and the server windows should connect

Job done.

Thanks and credits go to "MadByteDE" and "CWXDEV" (and the many other contributors) for the original guide I followed, there is also the automated install on "MadByteDE"s Github (Link Below), I chose the manual install as it was quicker and easier for me. I figured I would share this as it's another script that I have used on my system for games and such alike. This is not the orignal script but it's close and should function the same, I just adapted the readme into an easier format for my own reading. I do not take credit in developing the readme or anything associated with it,
