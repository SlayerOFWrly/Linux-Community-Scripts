I plan to share more Linux install scripts, ones I test and find useful, to help boost the search results for some of these projects, though this repo is not to be confused as a replacement for those who put in the time to create the original repos, it's good to have information spread out and not isolated to one source but also it can be good to have a centralised source so that others who have limited time can quickly find what they are looking for and install whilst offering the original links/credits to the devs themselves like I will (have done) here. 

I plan to build upon this repo in which I post many of the scripts and shortcuts I use/used for quick installs, trying to adapt them into an easier format for my own notation, maybe it helps you, so you can easily find what you need and install

Credits are appended to each config file for formatting, helps keep this read me section nice and clean <3

Also, if you find any Scripts, guides, or even game configurations that you find useful, could even be emulator configs to, feel free to open an issue request, make sure to link the orignal devs of the scripts and configurations, then we can test them out, if all goes well we can then add them to this repo for others to potentially find and make use of
