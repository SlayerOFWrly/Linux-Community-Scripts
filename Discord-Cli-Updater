Discord Update Shortcut

So discord on arch doesn't auto update, you have to manually unpack the .deb and convert to a useable package to install on Arch, 

Requirements: Debtap

Open Discord and when it prompts you to download the updater, Select the Ubuntu .deb,

it will save it to Downloads or your default location, 

now we run 
(replace 0.0.119 with the version in the filename)
debtap discord-0.0.119.deb 

lastly, sudo pacman -U discord-0.0.119-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst, 

No auto updaters required or security risks from using third party-clients, like (Defunkt thankfully) Bluecord, 
and the many others which siphened tokens to access accounts, 
all thanks to discord not requirng 2FA for QRLogins, meaning anyone could send spam from your account and read your DMs, 
A major security risk that is still not addressed. 
Never use the QRlogin, QR codes are not secure and if there is anything snooping between you and their servers (MITM) or a third party client
then they can collect and decrypt your token to then have access to your account,
